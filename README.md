# Time Series Analysis in Python - Thermal Energy Consumption
Repository contains my capstone project for postgraduate studies 'Data Warehouses and Data Analysis'.
## About Project
The goal of the project was to create an ARIMA model that predicts the total weekly consumption of thermal energy used to heat homes.
### Solution includes:
- Data cleanup and pre-processing
- Building ARIMA model
- Visualizing results
- Evaluation of model quality

### Used Python Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Pmdarima

### Dataset
The model was created using data from the measurements of 111 thermal energy meters, with a portion of the meters linked to measurements on energy consumption used for residential heating, while the rest of the meters include data on energy consumption used for water heating.

The data was collected on the basis of hourly measurements taken from 01.09.2015 to 28.02.2019.
